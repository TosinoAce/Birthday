        It is finally here!!!! my baby is 21 today and I am 21 times more
        excited than normal. You have been a light to this world in the past 21
        years and the 9 months that I have been a part of your shine I have been
        in awe. This cannot be overemphasized, you are a remarkable human being.
        You make sure everyone around you is taken care of and I know that I am
        in safe hands with you. You came into my life and changed my definition
        of love. You are my best friend, my companion, my gist partner, my
        accountability partner, my prayer partner, my baby and my lover. I think
        about our future together and there is no cause for worry because with
        you I have peace of mind. You are my safe space and I am eternally
        grateful to God and your family for you. I hope that I become a man that
        is deserving of someone like you because you are the best of God’s
        creations and I won the lottery the day you decided to be my girlfriend.
        I look forward to the very many more beautiful memories we will make
        together. The laughter and the cheers that will accompany us along the
        way. I pray that God rewards you for how awesome you are because an
        awesome person deserves awesome blessings. I pray that he raises people
        to bless you and guide you as climb to the top. I pray that you be a
        source of joy to your mom every single day and that whenever she and
        your siblings think about you that they are filled with joy. I love you
        baby and I want you to always remember that. Happy birthday my baby!
